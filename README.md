Simple CLI tool to extract plaintext FastLogs from Roblox binaries

### Installation

FastLogExtractor only comes in a portable executable, [you can find the latest release here](https://github.com/WaviestBalloon/FastLogExtractor/releases) for both Windows and Linux!

### Compiling

If you're on a Linux system, you can cross-compile with the shell scripts, `build-windows.sh` and `build-linux.sh`.

If you're on a Windows system, you can view the shell scripts and create your own batch files for automation.

You can always compile manually with `cargo build --release` if you do not wish to use the scripts.

### Usage

Simply drag and drop a Roblox binary onto the executable, or run it from the command line with the binary as an argument.
